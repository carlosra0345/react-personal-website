          <p>I am currently an undergraduate student at <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" className="link-style" href="https://www.tamu.edu/index.html" style={{ color: "#86fbfb" }}>Texas A&M University</a> pursuing a degree in Computer Science. </p>
          <p>Beyond my coursework, I am heavily involved on campus through my work as a student researcher within the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" className="link-style" href="https://www.math.tamu.edu/" style={{ color: "#86fbfb" }}>TAMU Department of Mathematics</a>, and my leadership role as an <a style={{ color: "#86fbfb" }}>Events and Marketing Officer at Aggie Coding Club</a>.</p>
          <p>This summer, I will be interning as a <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" className="link-style" href="https://www.mastercard.us/en-us/business/issuers/grow-your-business/open-banking-solutions.html" style={{ color: "#86fbfb" }}>Software Engineer at Mastercard</a>. I will be working with the platform engineering team to build Mastercardâ€™s developer platform and deployment systems.</p>
          <p>Outside of work, I enjoy experimenting with new technologies and working on personal projects. Currently, I am working on deploying my end-to-end encrypted chat application <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" className="link-style" href="https://github.com/aggie-coding-club/SecuroChat" style={{ color: "#86fbfb" }}>Securochat</a>! Additionally, I am working on developing a <a style={{ color: "#86fbfb" }}>Network Intrusion Detection System</a> using machine learning to interpret client network traffic in real time and response to malicious activity.</p>
          <p>On a more personal note, I am an avid swimmer, foodie, and wannabe guitarist! You can likely find me trying (and struggling) to learn music theory and binging my favorite shows! </p>
